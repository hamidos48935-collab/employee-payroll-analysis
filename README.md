mployee Payroll Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee payroll data to explore salary distribution, department-level compensation structures, and differences between salaried and hourly employees.

The objective is to extract actionable insights from raw payroll data and demonstrate strong Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data storytelling skills.

🎯 Business Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:

Understand salary distribution patterns

Identify compensation differences across departments

Compare salaried vs hourly employees

Detect salary outliers

Explore relationships between working hours and pay

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains payroll records including:

Employee Department

Pay Type (Salaried / Hourly)

Annual Salary

Hourly Rate

Typical Working Hours

🧹 Data Cleaning

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Removed currency symbols and converted salary fields to numeric format

Handled missing values appropriately

Checked for invalid or negative salary values

Identified potential outliers using boxplots

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key analysis steps included:

Salary distribution analysis (Histogram)

Outlier detection (Boxplot)

Department-level workforce size comparison

Average salary by department

Salary comparison between salaried and hourly employees

Correlation analysis between salary and working hours

🔎 Key Insights

Salary distribution is right-skewed, influenced by high-income positions.

Some departments show significantly higher average compensation.

Hourly employees demonstrate lower income stability compared to salaried employees.

There is weak correlation between working hours and total annual salary.

Large departments do not necessarily offer the highest salaries.

📌 Recommendations

Review salary structures in departments with high variance.

Investigate extreme salary outliers for compensation alignment.

Consider workforce balancing strategies where compensation does not align with workload.
